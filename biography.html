    <h2> ALBERT EINSTEIN</h2>
    <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of
      relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E
      = mc², which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation".</p>
    <p>Albert Einstein. In 1921, Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. He won the award for his
      discovery of the 'photoelectric effect'</p>
    <p>Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. As a child, he exhibited an extraordinary curiosity for and
      understanding of the mysteries of science. The young Einstein also took music lessons, playing both violin and
      piano; stoking a passion for music that he maintained throughout his life. Moving first to Italy and then
      Switzerland, the young prodigy graduated from high school in 1896.</p>
    <p>In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, Einstein had what came to be known as his “Annus
      Mirabilis” (miracle year). It was during this time that the young physicist obtained his Doctorate degree and
      published four of his most influential research papers, including the Special Theory of Relativity, the
      Photoelectric Effect, Brownian Motion, and Mass/Energy Equivalence, and his worldwide fame was assured. In 1915,
      Einstein completed his General Theory of Relativity, and brought to the world a fuller understanding of the
      interaction of space, time and gravity.

    <p>Einstein had three nationalities.
      He was German, Swiss and American.</p>

    <p>Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland.
      Their son Eduard was born in Zurich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months
      before Eduard's arrival, he described his love for his wife as "misguided" and mourned the "missed life" that he
      imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: "I think of you in heartfelt love every spare
      minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."</p>

    <p>In 1912, Einstein entered into a relationship with Elsa Löwenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's
      side and his second cousin on his father's. When Marić learned of his infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with
      him in April 1914, she returned to Zurich, taking Hans Albert and Eduard with her.Einstein and Marić were granted
      a divorce on 14 February 1919 on the grounds of having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce
      settlement, Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize, he would give the money that he received to
      Marić; he won the prize two years later.</p>

    The practical applications of Einstein’s theories include the development of everyday and indispensable items such
    as Televisions, Remote Controls, Digital Cameras, and GPS tracking systems.</p>
    <p>Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote:

      If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I
      see my life in terms of music ... I get most joy in life out of music.

      His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a
      love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein
      began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.</p>

    <p>On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm,
      which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was
      preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the
      hospital, but he did not live to complete it.

      Einstein refused surgery, saying, I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have
      done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly. He died in the Princeton Hospital early the next morning
      at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.

      During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein's brain for preservation without the
      permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made
      Einstein so intelligent.Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey, and his ashes were scattered at
      an undisclosed location.</p>
    <p>Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library, and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
      in Israel.</p>
